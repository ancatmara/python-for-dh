Saint Patrick's Day (Irish: Lá Fhéile Pádraig, "the Day of the Festival of Patrick"), is a cultural and religious celebration held on 17 March, the traditional death date of Saint Patrick (c. AD 385–461), the foremost patron saint of Ireland.

Patrick was a 5th-century Romano-British Christian missionary and bishop in Ireland. Much of what is known about Saint Patrick comes from the Declaration, which was allegedly written by Patrick himself. It is believed that he was born in Roman Britain in the fourth century, into a wealthy Romano-British family. His father was a deacon and his grandfather was a priest in the Christian church. According to the Declaration, at the age of sixteen, he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and taken as a slave to Gaelic Ireland. It says that he spent six years there working as a shepherd and that during this time he "found God". The Declaration says that God told Patrick to flee to the coast, where a ship would be waiting to take him home. After making his way home, Patrick went on to become a priest.

Patrick returned to Ireland to convert the pagan Irish to Christianity. The Declaration says that he spent many years evangelising in the northern half of Ireland and converted "thousands". Patrick's efforts against the druids were eventually turned into an allegory in which he drove "snakes" out of Ireland (Ireland never had any snakes).

According to legend, St. Patrick used the three-leaved shamrock to explain the Holy Trinity to Irish pagans.

Now Pádraig, Pádraic or Páraic is a traditional Irish male name. It  derives from the Latin Patricius, meaning "of the patrician class", introduced via the name of Saint Patrick. Patrick is the English version, via Old French. Pádraig is the most popular version of the name, but other variants include:

* Padraig
* Pádraic
* Padraic
* Padric
* Pádhraig
* Padhraig
* Padraigh
* Padhraic
* Pádhraic
* Páraic
* Paraic
* Pauric
* Phadrig

Diminutives include Páidín (Anglicised as "Podge" and "Paddy"); the latter Anglicisation is often used, sometimes pejoratively, as a term for Irish people as a whole.
